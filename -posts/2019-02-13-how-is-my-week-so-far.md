### How is my week so far

My week so far is interesting, On freecodecamp I've learned the basics of html(hyper text markup language) and it's used to create or build websites . Also I've learnt how inputs works and i found that input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user. 

Today i have learned a lot about Agile Methatology.Agile is a software development methatologies based on interactive development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross functioning teams.

Whenever I faced challenges, I was persisting and persevering.As they say dreams doesn't become reality through magic, it takes sweat,determination and hardwork.
